WHAT IS THIS?

This is the CursedCarHome Android application.  Source code is found at
Google Code:

THE PROBLEM

My Android phone is "cursed" periodically by a phantom that repeatedly turns on
the Car Home application as if the phone were being docked. (It's probably a
hardware problem.) Besides the annoyance caused by the Car Home homepage
itself, a bigger problem is that Car Home enables the speakerphone and never
turns it back off.

THE SOLUTION

I've tried several of the existing applications in the Android marketplace, but
nothing has quite worked for me. This application is my attempt to solve the
problem. It's a "big hammer" approach -- once a dock event is handled, a
background process starts.  This process watches for Car Home and kills it if
it's ever found running.  Separately, I also hook into the phone call process
to disable the speakerphone every time an inbound or outbound call is
initiated.  As a result, the application requires a lot of device permissions.

USING THE APPLICATION

The default configuration should work fine for most people.  If you tend to see
clusters of events over a period of time, you may want to change some values.

For instance, on my phone, I often get several to a dozen dock events over a 30
minute window (or sometimes even longer).  When first started, the background
process is very aggressive about how often it looks for problems.  As the time
between discovered problems grows, the background process gradually slows down
and looks for problems less often.

If you are seeing clusters of events, you may find that it takes too long for
the background process to notice problems and clean them up.  You can adjust
this behavior by decreasing the maximum delay.  You may also want to increase
the maximum lifetime of the background process.

I find the daily report useful, because it alerts me to problems that might
have occurred when I was not looking at the phone (such as overnight when
I am sleeping).  However, you can disable the report if you want to.  Even if
the daily report is disabled, you can always run the report manually. Open
the application and choosing Menu > Run Daily Report.

REQUIRED PERMISSIONS

Cursed Car Home requires a set of fairly intrusive set of device permissions.
I wish I could do with less, but part of the reason Cursed Car Home works
better for me than other applications is because it's different -- and the
things it does require a lot of permissions. Below is a list of the required
permissions and what they are needed for.
