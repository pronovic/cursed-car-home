This is the CursedCarHome Android application.  Source code is found at

My T-Mobile G2 Android phone, getting up there in years, is "cursed"
periodically by a phantom that repeatedly turns on the Car Home application as
if the phone were being docked. (It's probably a hardware problem, i.e. due to
dirt on the USB port, but repeated cleaning hasn't really resolved the
situation.)

Besides the annoyance caused by the actual invocation of the Car Home
application, a bigger problem is that Car Home enables the speakerphone and
never turns it back off. It's not a good situation.

I've tried several of the existing applications in the Android
marketplace, but nothing has quite worked for me. This application is my
attempt to solve the problem. It's a "big hammer" -- there's a service which
kills Car Home if it's ever found running, and I hook into the phone call
process to disable the speakerphone every time an inbound or outbound call is
initiated. (This can be controlled by configuration.)

I'm still testing, but so far it seems to work ok. After I get some more
confidence that what I'm doing doesn't hurt anything, I will probably release
this to the marketplace. Before then, I just want to make the code available so
it's useful to others you might have the same problem.
